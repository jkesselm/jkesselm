- 👋 Hi, I’m @jkesselm, aka jkesselm@apache.org, aka keshlam@kubyc.solutions, aka keshlam at many other places
- 👀 As @jkesselm, my primary interest is supporting Apache tools, specifically Xalan and Xerces
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning how Apache has structured its repository
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Xalan and Xerces right now; others possible
- 📫 dev@[projectname].apache.org is preferred for project issues. Email should work, but please be aware that it is being spamfiltered viciously.
